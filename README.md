To run the code successfully, you'll need the following dependencies and prerequisites:

1. Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Required Python packages:
   - `speech_recognition`: Used for speech recognition. Install it using `pip`:
     ```
     pip install SpeechRecognition
     ```
   - `gtts`: Used to convert text to speech. Install it using `pip`:
     ```
     pip install gtts
     ```
   - `pyttsx3`: Used as an alternative for text-to-speech. Install it using `pip`:
     ```
     pip install pyttsx3
     ```
   - `wikipedia`: Used to fetch information from Wikipedia. Install it using `pip`:
     ```
     pip install wikipedia-api
     ```
   - `pyjokes`: Used to generate random jokes. Install it using `pip`:
     ```
     pip install pyjokes
     ```
   - `pywhatkit`: Used to interact with YouTube and perform web searches. Install it using `pip`:
     ```
     pip install pywhatkit
     ```

3. Platform-specific libraries:
   - macOS:
     - `afplay` for playing audio. It is typically pre-installed on macOS, so no additional installation is required.

   - Windows:
     - The `start` command for opening applications should be available by default on Windows.

   - Linux:
     - `xdg-open` for opening applications. It should be available by default on most Linux distributions.

4. Microphone: Ensure you have a working microphone connected to your computer if you want to interact with the assistant using voice commands.

Once you have Python and the required packages installed, and you have verified that your microphone is working, you can execute the script. Save the code into a Python file (e.g., `friday_assistant.py`), and then run it using the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

```
python friday_assistant.py
```

The script will start the assistant, and you can interact with it using the specified voice commands. Please note that the code uses Google's speech recognition service, so make sure you have an active internet connection during its operation.
